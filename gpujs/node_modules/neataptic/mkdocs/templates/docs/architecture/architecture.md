If you want to built your completely custom neural network; this is the place to be.
You can build your network from the bottom, using nodes and connections, or you can
ease up the process by using groups and layers.

* [Connection](connection.md)
* [Node](node.md)
* [Group](group.md)
* [Layer](layer.md)
* [Network](network.md)
* [Construct](construct.md)
