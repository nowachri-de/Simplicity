Welcome to the documentation of Neataptic! If you are a rookie with neural networks:
check out any of the tutorials on the left to get started. If you want more
information about a certain part of Neataptic, it most probably is also in the
menu on the left. If it isn't, feel free to let me know by creating an [issue](https://github.com/wagenaartje/neataptic/issues).

If you want to implement a genetic neural network algorithm, but don't know how,
feel free to contact me at [wagenaartje@protonmail.com](mailto:wagenaartje@protonmail.com)!
