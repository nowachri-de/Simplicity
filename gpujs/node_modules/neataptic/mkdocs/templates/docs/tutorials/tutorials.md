In order to get you started on Neataptic, a few tutorials have been written that
give a basic overview on how to create, train and evolve your networks. It is
recommended to read all of them before you start digging in your own project.

* [Training](training.md)
* [Evolution](evolution.md)
* [Normalization](normalization.md)
* [Visualization](visualization.md)
